Snake Class: The Snake class defines the properties and behavior of the snake in the game. It includes methods for moving the snake, turning the snake, resetting the snake, and drawing the snake on the screen.

Food Class: The Food class defines the properties and behavior of the food that appears on the screen for the snake to eat. It includes a method for drawing the food on the screen.

Game Loop: The game loop is a continuous loop that runs while the game is being played. It includes logic for handling user input, updating the game state, and drawing the game on the screen.

Screen: The screen is the graphical user interface (GUI) window where the game is displayed. It is created using the Pygame display module and is updated continuously during the game loop.

Colors: The colors used in the game are defined as tuples of RGB values. These tuples are used to draw the snake, food, and other elements on the screen.

Random Module: The random module is used to generate random numbers for various purposes in the game, such as choosing the initial direction of the snake and generating random positions for the food.
